The files here are name constrained due to the 250 character limit, therefore the names do not give all the information needed.

For now here is list over what the applications do:

GNSS: Gets GNSS fix and prints it to serial

LTE: Gets GNSS fix while LTE-m is active. This GNSS fix is sent to an echo server when a button is pressed. Uses PSM and eDRX to give GNSS access to the antenna.

NTN: Will be used for NTN testing, but has not yet been made.
